# React-Project02

Hello Class! we challange U to work on a project using what you have learned until won :) 

...

sorry, now*.

...

The project idea is totally up to U. We just want you to build a project using React's following concepts: 
- Functional Components.
- Styling Components (ex. Bootstrap).
- State.
- Component Lifecycle Methods.
- Hooks.
- Routing.



## Group Members Requirements
- Each group should have **2** to **3** memberes.
- Work on the same project using **GitHub**.
- Each member should have specific role and responsibilities in the project development process.
- Each group should have a unique idea.


### One More Thing!
- Build a ChatBot to help us when we have a problem using your APP. ([reference for ChatBot Idea](https://github.com/Tuwaiq-JavaScript/ChatBotApp/blob/main/README.md))
